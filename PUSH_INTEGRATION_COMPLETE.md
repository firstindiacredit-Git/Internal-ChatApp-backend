# ‚úÖ Push Notifications Integration - Complete

Push notifications have been successfully integrated into your internal chat application!

## üéâ What's Been Integrated

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **Service Worker** (`Frontend/public/push-sw.js`)
- Handles incoming push notifications
- Shows notifications even when app is closed
- Manages notification clicks and actions

#### 2. **Push Notification Service** (`Frontend/src/services/pushNotifications.js`)
- `subscribeToPushNotifications()` - Subscribe users to push
- `unsubscribeFromPushNotifications()` - Unsubscribe users
- `checkPushSubscription()` - Check subscription status
- `initializePushNotifications()` - Auto-initialize for logged-in users

#### 3. **AuthContext Integration** (`Frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)
- Automatically subscribes users to push notifications on login
- Re-subscribes users when they refresh the page (if logged in)
- Seamless integration with existing authentication flow

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **Push Notification Routes** (`Backend/routes/pushNotifications.js`)
- Enhanced to store subscriptions with user IDs
- Added `sendPushToUser(userId, title, body, icon, data)` helper function
- Supports user-specific push notifications

#### 2. **Server Integration** (`Backend/server.js`)
- **Personal Messages**: Sends push notifications to offline users when they receive a message
- **Group Messages**: Sends push notifications to all offline group members when a message is sent
- Only sends push to users who are not currently online (smart notification)

#### 3. **Configuration** (`Backend/config.env`)
- VAPID keys configured and ready to use

## üöÄ How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User Logs In**
   ```
   User Login ‚Üí AuthContext ‚Üí Auto-subscribe to Push Notifications
   ```

2. **User Receives Message (Offline)**
   ```
   Message Sent ‚Üí Backend Checks if User is Online ‚Üí User is Offline
   ‚Üí Send Push Notification ‚Üí User's Device Shows Notification
   ```

3. **User Receives Message (Online)**
   ```
   Message Sent ‚Üí Backend Checks if User is Online ‚Üí User is Online
   ‚Üí No Push Notification (already in app)
   ```

### Technical Flow

#### Personal Messages
```javascript
// When user sends a message
socket.on("send-message", async (data) => {
  // ... save message ...
  
  // Check if receiver is online
  const receiverOnline = activeUsers.has(receiver);
  
  if (!receiverOnline) {
    // Send push notification
    sendPushToUser(
      receiver,
      `New message from ${senderName}`,
      messagePreview,
      senderProfileImage,
      { type: "personal-message", senderId, messageId }
    );
  }
});
```

#### Group Messages
```javascript
// When user sends a group message
socket.on("send-group-message", async (data) => {
  // ... save message ...
  
  // Notify offline group members
  group.members.forEach((member) => {
    if (memberId !== sender && !activeUsers.has(memberId)) {
      sendPushToUser(
        memberId,
        `${senderName} in ${groupName}`,
        messagePreview,
        senderProfileImage,
        { type: "group-message", groupId, senderId, messageId }
      );
    }
  });
});
```

## üì± Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features

1. **Auto-Subscribe on Login**
   - Users are automatically subscribed to push notifications when they log in
   - No manual action required from users

2. **Smart Notifications**
   - Only sends push notifications to offline users
   - Online users receive real-time updates via Socket.IO (no push needed)

3. **Personal Message Notifications**
   - Shows sender name and message preview
   - Includes sender's profile image
   - Contains metadata for tracking (senderId, messageId)

4. **Group Message Notifications**
   - Shows "Sender in Group Name" format
   - Message preview included
   - Only notifies offline members (not sender or online members)

5. **Rich Notifications**
   - Title, body, icon, badge
   - Vibration pattern
   - Click actions (Open/Close)

6. **Notification Management**
   - Clicking notification opens/focuses the app
   - Failed subscriptions are automatically cleaned up
   - Subscription status tracked per user

## üß™ Testing

### Test the Integration

1. **Start the Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Scenario 1: Personal Message (Offline)**
   - Login as User A on Device/Browser 1
   - Login as User B on Device/Browser 2
   - Close or minimize User B's browser/tab
   - Send a message from User A to User B
   - ‚úÖ User B should receive a push notification

4. **Test Scenario 2: Group Message (Offline)**
   - Create a group with User A, B, and C
   - Login as all users
   - Close User B and C's browsers
   - User A sends a message to the group
   - ‚úÖ Users B and C should receive push notifications

5. **Test Scenario 3: No Notification (Online)**
   - Login as User A and User B
   - Keep both browsers open
   - Send messages between them
   - ‚úÖ No push notifications (messages appear in real-time via Socket.IO)

### Check Push Subscription Status

Open browser console and check:
```javascript
// Check if subscribed
localStorage.getItem('pushSubscriptionEndpoint')

// Should show endpoint if subscribed
```

## üîç Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging

Backend logs automatically show:
```
‚úÖ New push subscription for user: 6789abc...
üìä Total subscriptions: 3
üì§ Push notification sent to user: 6789abc...
```

Frontend logs show:
```
‚úÖ Push notifications initialized
‚úÖ Service Worker registered
‚úÖ Push subscription created
‚úÖ Push subscription saved to server
```

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Push notifications not initialized"
- **Cause**: VAPID keys not configured or browser doesn't support push
- **Solution**: Check `config.env` has VAPID keys, use supported browser

#### 2. "No push subscription found for user"
- **Cause**: User hasn't logged in or subscription failed
- **Solution**: User needs to login to trigger auto-subscribe

#### 3. Service Worker not registering
- **Cause**: HTTPS required (except localhost)
- **Solution**: Use localhost for development or deploy with HTTPS

#### 4. Notifications not showing
- **Cause**: Browser permission denied
- **Solution**: Check browser notification settings and allow permissions

## üìä Monitoring

### Subscription Count
Check how many users are subscribed:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5002/api/push-notifications/subscription-count
```

### Backend Console
Monitor push notification activity:
- `‚úÖ New push subscription for user: [userId]`
- `üì§ Push notification sent to user: [userId]`
- `‚ÑπÔ∏è No push subscription found for user: [userId]`

## üîí Security Notes

1. **VAPID Keys are Secure**
   - Private key stored in `config.env` (not committed to git)
   - Public key safe to expose to frontend

2. **User-Specific Subscriptions**
   - Each subscription linked to a user ID
   - Users can only receive their own notifications

3. **Production Considerations**
   - Store subscriptions in database (currently in-memory)
   - Add subscription expiry handling
   - Implement retry logic for failed sends
   - Add rate limiting to prevent spam

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Before Deploying:

1. **Store Subscriptions in Database**
   - Create a `PushSubscription` model
   - Link subscriptions to User model
   - Persist across server restarts

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure VAPID keys are set in production environment
   - Never commit keys to version control

3. **HTTPS Required**
   - Service Workers require HTTPS in production
   - Get SSL certificate for your domain

4. **Error Handling**
   - Add comprehensive error logging
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Handle subscription expiry

## üìà Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Store subscriptions in MongoDB
- [ ] Add notification preferences (mute, do not disturb)
- [ ] Group notification settings
- [ ] Read receipts via push notifications
- [ ] Call notifications (incoming call alerts)
- [ ] Typing indicators via push
- [ ] Admin dashboard for push analytics
- [ ] A/B testing for notification copy
